# Summary of lecture 1
## 01-Gene and Genome
### definition
A gene is a piece of __information__ 
A genome is a set of genes

### size&number of human genome&genes
* Homo sapiens don't have the largest genome:
Human-3Gbp
Amoeba-670 Gbp

* Homo sapiens also have few genes compared to organisms with lower complexity
Human-21,000
C.elegans-20,000

### non-coding sequences of the human genome
* high percent of genome not coding for protein
* some regions are not transcribed at all
* different types of non-protein-coding RNAs
..* catalytic RNA
..* miRNA
..* LincRNAs

## 02-Sequencing & Computing
### sequencing: __*obtaining*__ information about the code of life
* sequencing technologies:revolution
..* single molecule sequencing
..* big and high-dimensional data

### computing: bioinformatics

3 steps of bioinformatics
1. information
medical/biological data
2. model
mathematical & probability model
3. algorithm
computational algorithm


1. information
..* images/sequences
2. model
..* definition: output analysis of the input data
..* could be the result of running the machine-learning algorithm
..* used for prediction on new data
..* different types of models:
..1. regression model: e.g. linear regression / logistic regression
..2. tree model
3. algorithm
..* general approach of analyzing data
..* used for generating a model in machine learning
..* different types of algorithms:
..1. number sorting algorithm
..2. dynamic programming algorithm

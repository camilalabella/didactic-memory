# Bioinformatics learning plans
## biological basics
* What we can infer from the genomic data
  * sequence alignment
  * conservation & evolution
  * function analysis
  * regulation
  * interaction between biomolecules
  * structures of biomolecules

* How can we obtain & store biological data
  * Next generation sequencing
  * databases
  * predicted structures of biomolecules


## Computational skills
Bioinformatics is more about using "informatics" in practice to solve biological problems
Practice makes perfect!


* the basics of the Linux system
* programming with R/Python
* machine learning


## Problem solving: what can we do with bioinformatics
* analysing NGS data
* obtaining route of evolution from sequence alignment
* predicting structures of biomolecules
* biomolecule function analysis: e.g. RNA
